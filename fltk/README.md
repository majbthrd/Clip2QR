Clip2QR - FLTK build instructions
=================================

## Building

For a Linux platform, install the prerequisite packages:

```
sudo apt install build-essential libfltk1.3-dev
```

and then do a make:

```
make
```

For other platforms, you will need to research how to:
1) use your compiler of choice, and 
2) build and install the (FLTK library)[https://www.fltk.org/)
